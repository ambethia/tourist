= Tourist

The Tourist plugin is like having a tour guide through the views of your Rails application.
You'll see comments in your rhtml views like: 

  <!-- BEGIN script/../config/../app/views/narwhal/index.rhtml {{{ -->

It can really help find those pesky partials in a foreign app. To start using Tourist, in your
environment.rb, just put something like:

  Ambethia::Tourist.see! if RAILS_ENV == 'development'

=== TODO

 * Strip default template path from output (ex: script/../config/../app/views)
 * Tests!
